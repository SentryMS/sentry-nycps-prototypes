GeoTabs are fixed on board the vehicle providing telematic data provided through a connector to the vehicles OBDll port (this GPS does not support any driver or route details). In addition Drivers carry on board a cellular phone, brand Samsung, models SM-A125F, SM-A125U, SM-A146U, SM-A156U, SM-A205U, SM- S205DL, and SM-A205U1 (depending on date of issue). These are utilized with vendor provided software for providing driver ID, route ID, student ridership ID, time, and vehicle starting and present and historic (after subscription) location.</span>

                    <span class="qa-question">Q12: Section 14 There is reference to development team being in NY City. On the pre-bid call, I have notes that includes information about being located in the "Geographic Market". I believe that I need clarification. Can you verify that the: 1.DedicatedDevelopmentteammustbeinNewYorkCity? Orare some allowed in a local office location as well? <br>Q17: Section 2.3 Lists a requirement for a local software development team based in New York City. Establishing such a team will require time and substantial investment and thus we assume it is reasonable for vendors to not have such a team in place by the time of their submission. Is this correct? If so, then should vendors include in their proposals their anticipated timelines for establishing the local development team after being awarded the contract? Does the DOE have any other guidance to provide on this requirement?</span>
                    <span class="qa-response">A: The development team can operate from anywhere in the USA, but the OPT office provides space for project managers and developers to attend meetings and work on- site. OPT requires members of the app dev and data teams to attend in-person working sessions. A ground support team based in NYC is required for device management, installation, and repairs.</span>

The mount is paired with a secondary source of power charging cord (primary power is currently resident of the portable device (phone battery) recharged daily after use when off the vehicle). The RAM mount is comprised of a dashboard mount, connected to swivel arm, and an X- grip to hold a cell phone. These parts are interchangeable to support other devices for example; a tablet. Additionally GeoTab GO9+ GPS are already installed under the dashboard near the vehicles OBD port. All equipment is in good condition. The RAM-Xgrip is built to allow X grips can be replaced from current Cell Phone holder to a tablet size X-grip. On Board secondary power is C-type device plug in and may be reused.

Subparagraph “b” reads that waiver requests must be submitted 12 business days prior to the proposal due date.

The problem issue integration is to ensure NYC OPT DOE is tracking the vendor problem success in identifying problems, ensuring problems are resolved with the least amount of impact to service and provides data for analysis for future problem and problem handling time improvements.

                    <span class="qa-response">A: GPS Inventory is tracked utilizing data provided by the GPS vendor and inventory updates for on and off equipment provided by school bus companies. GPS issues are identified through DOE routine practice of monitoring GPS vendor reports for non- working problematic GPS system issues. There is no current integration of these reports.</span>

The problem issue integration is to ensure NYC OPT DOE is tracking the vendor problem success in identifying problems, ensuring problems are resolved with the least amount of impact to service and provides data for analysis for future problem and problem handling time improvements.

                    <span class="qa-response">A: NYC DOE OPT requirements for reported service problems directly related to the service provided by the GPS vendor to be managed by the vendor from receipt of the service issue of the problem to resolution, while keeping effected user(s) notified throughout the lifecycle of the problem. Data collection and reporting needs to be comprehensive to understand the source, cause, fix, and resolution times associated with the problem. The problem issue integration is to ensure NYC OPT DOE is tracking the vendor problem success in identifying problems, ensuring problems are resolved with the least amount of impact to service and provides data for analysis for future problem and problem handling time improvements. Current report rate data for daily reported problems are of insignificance as the selected product of choice is expected to have advantages in problem identification (pro-active repair and product maintenance advantages).</span>

This will align service delivery expectations for the reporting party and work load prediction for the vendor. Appointment confirmation is a documented commitment by the vendor for when the pending work activity will be performed and notification to the reporting party as to when.</span>

                    <span class="qa-response">A: This reference to 8 or more in a borough allows the GPS vendor to establish a work day calendar where 8 or more repairs and installations can be scheduled to more than one School Bus Company.
