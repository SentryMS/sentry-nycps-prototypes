    <h1>RFP R1804 Transportation Management System - Requirements Traceability Matrix</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        This document provides a detailed traceability matrix for the requirements outlined in the Request for Proposals (RFP) R1804 for the New York City Public Schools (NYCPS) Office of Pupil Transportation (OPT) Transportation Management System. It aims to capture and track all specified requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
        <br>
        <strong>Important Note on 'Implemented' Column:</strong>
        '<strong>Yes</strong>' (Green) indicates the requirement from the RFP text has been acknowledged and included in this tracking document. It does <strong>not</strong> signify that the requirement has been coded or deployed in the final system.
        '<strong>No</strong>' (Red) would indicate a requirement identified in the RFP source text that was missed in this document.
        '<strong>TBD</strong>' (Amber) is used primarily for Minimum Qualifications (dependent on the vendor) or where the status is genuinely unknown. The actual implementation status of all system features is pending design and development.
    </p>

    <h2>Minimum Qualifications (Section 2)</h2>
    <p>These requirements pertain to the eligibility and capabilities of the proposing vendor, rather than the functional aspects of the system itself. They are typically assessed during the vendor evaluation phase.</p>
