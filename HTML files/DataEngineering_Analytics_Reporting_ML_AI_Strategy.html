    <h1>NYCPS TMS: Prescriptive Data Engineering, Analytics & AI/ML Strategy</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro-data">
        <h2>I. Introduction: Data as a Strategic Asset</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>This document establishes the comprehensive, best-in-class strategy for managing the entire data and AI/ML lifecycle within the NYCPS Transportation Management System (TMS) project. Recognizing that data is not just a byproduct but a core strategic asset for optimizing operations, ensuring safety, providing transparency, and driving continuous improvement, this strategy mandates rigorous, modern practices across Data Engineering (DE), Data Quality (DQ), Data Performance, Reporting, Visualization, Analytics, Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Given the project's complexity, the sensitivity of PII/MNPI data, the diverse data ecosystem (streaming IoT, batch feeds, on-premise systems, 3rd party data, cloud services), and the absolute criticality of compliance and reliability, this strategy integrates DataOps, MLOps, and elements of AIOps principles within the overarching DevSecOps framework. It details the "what" and the "how" for building and operating a robust, secure, compliant, and high-performance data platform on AWS GovCloud using GitLab for CI/CD.</p>
            <div class="compliance-note">Adherence to this strategy, alongside the overarching Data Governance & Management Strategy, is mandatory to mitigate risks and ensure the responsible, ethical, and effective use of data.</div>

    <!-- Data Engineering Strategy -->
    <section id="data-engineering">
        <h2>IV. Prescriptive Data Engineering Strategy</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>Data Engineering provides the reliable foundation for all data-driven activities, ensuring data is available, accurate, secure, and performant across all environments.</p>

            <h3>A. Data Infrastructure Provisioning & Management (Non-Prod & Prod)</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h4>1. Non-Production Environments (Dev, QA, Staging, Perf, DS Sandboxes)</h4>
                <h5>What:</h5> Provide isolated, scalable, and cost-effective environments with production-like architecture but using masked/synthetic data for development, testing, and data science experimentation.
                <h5>How (Implementation):</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>**IaC for Data Resources:** Use dedicated Terraform modules (from the central `infra-tf/modules/` repo) to provision all data infrastructure (RDS, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, S3, Glue Jobs, Redshift clusters/schemas, SageMaker instances/notebook environments) per environment.</li>
                    <li>**Environment Parameterization:** Use environment-specific `.tfvars` files (`dev.tfvars`, `qa.tfvars`, etc.) to control instance sizes, cluster counts, storage allocation, IAM roles, security groups, KMS keys, and *crucially, pointers to masked/synthetic data sources*.</li>
                    <li>**Data Isolation:** Ensure strict network isolation (separate VPCs or subnets/SGs) and IAM controls prevent non-prod environments from accessing production data stores.</li>
                    <li>**Masked/Synthetic Data Pipelines:** Implement automated ETL pipelines (Glue, Lambda) to populate non-prod databases/S3 buckets with refreshed, structurally valid, but anonymized/synthesized data according to the TDM strategy (see Testing Strategy) and Data Governance Policy. Schedule regular refreshes.</li>
                    <li>**Cost Controls:** Implement aggressive auto-scaling down/shutdown policies for non-prod resources during off-hours (via Lambda/EventBridge or instance scheduler). Use smaller instance types where feasible. Set strict AWS Budgets alerts for non-prod accounts/tags.</li>
                    <li>**DS Sandboxes:** Provision isolated sandbox environments (potentially using SageMaker Studio user profiles or dedicated accounts/VPCs) with access only to approved, anonymized datasets for experimentation.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: DevOps Team (IaC Execution), Data Engineers (Data-specific IaC modules, Masking Pipelines), Cloud Ops/FinOps (Cost Controls), Security Team (IAM/Network Policies).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h4>2. Production Environment</h4>
                <h5>What:</h5> Provision highly available, scalable, secure, performant, and meticulously monitored production data infrastructure.
                <h5>How (Implementation):</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>**IaC Deployment:** All production data infrastructure provisioned and managed *exclusively* via the approved Terraform code base deployed through the rigorous GitLab CI/CD pipeline (requiring manual approvals). No manual console changes allowed.</li>
                    <li>**High Availability:** Deploy stateful resources (RDS, ElastiCache, MSK) across multiple (typically 3) Availability Zones using built-in HA features (Multi-AZ RDS, Redis cluster mode, MSK multi-broker replication). Ensure stateless processing layers (Lambda, Fargate) run across multiple AZs behind load balancers.</li>
                    <li>**Scalability:** Configure auto-scaling for compute (Fargate/ECS Services, Lambda Provisioned Concurrency if needed) and potentially databases (RDS Read Replicas, DynamoDB On-Demand/Auto Scaling). Monitor capacity proactively (see SRE practices).</li>
                    <li>**Security:** Apply strictest security controls: least-privilege IAM roles, granular Security Groups/NACLs, encryption at rest (KMS CMKs) and in transit (TLS 1.2+), private subnets, VPC Endpoints, mandatory audit logging.</li>
                    <li>**Backup & DR:** Implement automated, encrypted backups (AWS Backup, RDS/DynamoDB native) with cross-region replication to the DR AWS GovCloud region. Regularly test restore procedures and full DR failover (as per DR Plan).</li>
                </ol>
                 <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: DevOps Team (IaC Execution), SRE/Ops Team (Monitoring, HA/DR Config), Security Team (Control Validation), DBA (DB Config).</p>

            <h3>B. Data Ingestion Pipelines (Streaming & Batch)</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                 <h4>1. Streaming Ingestion (e.g., GPS, Real-time Ridership)</h4>
                 <h5>What:</h5> Ingest high-volume, low-latency data reliably from devices and applications.
                 <h5>How (Implementation):</h5>
                 <ol>
                    <li>**Endpoint:** Use AWS IoT Core (for MQTT devices) with rules forwarding to Kinesis/MSK, OR use API Gateway (HTTP API for performance) invoking Lambda or directly integrating with Kinesis/MSK.</li>
                    <li>**Transport:** Use Kinesis Data Streams (easier management) or Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK - for Kafka ecosystem compatibility/control) as the primary streaming backbone. Provision sufficient shards/brokers based on load testing. Enable server-side encryption.</li>
                    <li>**Processing:** Use Lambda functions triggered by Kinesis/MSK streams OR Fargate/ECS services consuming from streams for validation, transformation, enrichment, and routing to downstream stores (e.g., DynamoDB for real-time state, S3 data lake for raw/processed records, potentially other SQS queues).</li>
                    <li>**Error Handling:** Implement DLQs for Lambda triggers or robust error handling within consumer applications to route failed messages for investigation without blocking the stream. Monitor processing lag (`IteratorAge` for Kinesis).</li>
                    <li>**Schema Enforcement:** Use Glue Schema Registry (if using Kafka/Kinesis with Avro/Protobuf) or implement schema validation within ingestion Lambdas/services.</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Data Engineers, Backend Developers, DevOps Team (Infra).</p>

                <h4>2. Batch Ingestion (e.g., Daily extracts from ATS/NPSIS, 3rd party files)</h4>
                 <h5>What:</h5> Reliably ingest bulk data from files or database extracts on a scheduled basis.
                 <h5>How (Implementation):</h5>
                 <ol>
                    <li>**Transport:** Use AWS Transfer Family for secure SFTP endpoints where external systems push files. Use S3 Event Notifications to trigger processing when files arrive in designated landing zone buckets. For DB extracts, use AWS DMS (if feasible/approved for direct connection) or scheduled export jobs pushing files to S3.</li>
                    <li>**Orchestration:** Use AWS Step Functions or AWS Glue Workflows to orchestrate multi-step batch processing jobs (e.g., download -> validate -> transform -> load -> quality check -> archive).</li>
                    <li>**Processing:** Use AWS Glue ETL jobs (PySpark/Scala) for complex transformations and large volumes. Use Lambda functions for simpler tasks (file validation, triggering jobs).</li>
                    <li>**Validation & Quality:** Integrate data validation and Glue Data Quality checks within the batch workflow. Route failed files/records to an error location/queue.</li>
                    <li>**Scheduling:** Use EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) Scheduler or Glue Triggers to run batch jobs on the required cadence.</li>
                    <li>**Monitoring:** Monitor job success/failure, duration, and data quality results via CloudWatch Logs/Metrics and Glue Job metrics. Set alarms on failures or excessive runtimes.</li>
                 </ol>
                  <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Data Engineers, ETL Developers, DevOps Team (Infra/Scheduling).</p>
            </div>

             <h3>C. Data Transformation & Modeling (Lakehouse Approach)</h3>
             <div class="subsection">
                <h4>What:</h4> Transform raw ingested data into cleaned, structured, and modeled datasets suitable for reporting, analytics, and ML, utilizing a Lakehouse architecture (combining Data Lake flexibility with Data Warehouse structure).
                <h4>How (Implementation):</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>**Data Lake (S3):**
                        <ul>
                            <li>Store raw, immutable ingested data in a dedicated S3 "Raw Zone" bucket (partitioned by source/date).</li>
                            <li>Store cleaned, standardized, validated data (e.g., in Parquet format) in an S3 "Processed Zone" or "Staging Zone" bucket (partitioned appropriately for query performance).</li>
                            <li>Store highly curated, aggregated, or feature-engineered data for ML/Analytics in an S3 "Curated Zone" or "Gold Zone".</li>
                            <li>Utilize AWS Glue Data Catalog to catalog schemas and partitions across all zones, enabling query engines like Athena and Redshift Spectrum to access S3 data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Data Warehouse (Redshift):**
                        <ul>
                           <li>Provision an AWS Redshift cluster (Serverless for variable workloads or Provisioned RA3 nodes for predictable high performance) for storing modeled, aggregated data optimized for BI and analytics queries.</li>
                           <li>Design dimensional models (Star/Snowflake schemas) within Redshift for key business domains (Ridership Performance, Route Efficiency, Student Transportation Needs).</li>
                           <li>Load data into Redshift from the S3 Processed/Curated Zone using `COPY` commands, Glue ETL jobs, or Redshift Spectrum external tables (querying S3 directly).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Transformation Logic (ETL/ELT):**
                        <ul>

                <h4>Implementation How-To:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>**CI/CD for Data Pipelines:**
                        <ul>
                           <li>Store all data pipeline code (Glue scripts, Python Lambda functions, SQL transformation scripts, dbt models, Terraform for data infra) in GitLab.</li>
                           <li>Implement dedicated GitLab CI/CD pipelines for data jobs:
                               <ul>
                                   <li>Lint code (SQLFluff, Pylint).</li>
                                   <li>Unit test transformation logic (pytest for Python, dbt test for dbt models).</li>
                                   <li>Integration test pipeline components against test environments (e.g., run Glue job against test S3 data/Redshift schema).</li>
                                   <li>Package code (e.g., zip Lambda, package Glue scripts).</li>
                                   <li>Deploy infrastructure changes (Terraform apply for Glue jobs, Lambda functions, Step Functions).</li>
                                   <li>Deploy updated pipeline logic/code.</li>
                               </ul>
                           </li>
                            <li>Use environment branches or parameterization for deploying pipelines to Dev/QA/Prod environments.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Automated Data Quality Testing:** Integrate automated DQ checks (Glue DQ, Great Expectations, dbt tests) directly into pipeline execution. Fail pipelines if critical quality thresholds are breached.</li>
                    <li>**Automated Schema Management:** Use tools like Glue Schema Registry or manage database schema changes via migration tools (Flyway/Liquibase triggered by CI/CD) integrated with pipeline deployments.</li>
                    <li>**Pipeline Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement detailed monitoring for pipeline execution (Glue/Step Functions metrics, CloudWatch logs). Alert on failures, excessive runtimes, or data quality issues detected within the pipeline.</li>
                    <li>**Data Lineage Tracking:** Utilize Glue Data Catalog and potentially third-party tools to automatically track data lineage from source through transformations to consumption layers (Warehouse/Reports).</li>
                    <li>**Collaboration:** Use shared code repositories (GitLab), documented processes (Confluence), and integrated tracking (Jira) for collaboration between DE, Analytics, DS, and Ops.</li>

        <h2>V. Prescriptive Data Quality & Performance Testing</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>Ensuring the quality and performance of data itself, and the pipelines processing it, is critical for trust and usability.</p>
            <h3>A. Data Quality Framework & Testing</h3>
             <div class="implementation-detail">
                <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>**Rule Definition:** Data Stewards, working with BAs and Analysts, define specific, measurable Data Quality rules for CDEs in the TMS Data Governance Policy / Data Dictionary (e.g., `student_id` must exist in ATS/NPSIS master, `gps_timestamp` must be within +/- 5 mins of system time, `route_eta` must not be null for active routes, `vehicle_capacity_used` <= `vehicle_capacity_total`).</li>
                    <li>**DQ Check Implementation:**
                        <ul>
                           <li>**Ingestion:** Implement basic format/type validation at ingestion points (APIs, Lambdas).</li>
                           <li>**Transformation (ETL/ELT):** Embed complex DQ rule checks directly into Glue jobs (using Glue Data Quality) or dbt models (using `dbt test`). Checks can include uniqueness, referential integrity, accepted values, null checks, range checks, regex patterns, custom SQL assertions.</li>
                           <li>**At Rest:** Develop scheduled Lambda functions or use tools like Great Expectations (potentially run via Glue/EMR) to run quality checks directly against Data Lake (S3/Athena) or Warehouse (Redshift) tables periodically.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Automation & Gating:** Integrate DQ check execution into DataOps CI/CD pipelines. **Quality Gate:** Fail pipeline builds/deployments if critical DQ checks fail (e.g., > X% nulls in required field, referential integrity broken).</li>
                    <li>**Monitoring & Reporting:** Send DQ check results (pass/fail counts, specific failing records) to CloudWatch Metrics/Logs. Create Data Quality Dashboards (QuickSight/Grafana) visualizing quality scores/trends per data domain/source. Alert Data Stewards/Support on critical DQ failures.</li>
                    <li>**Issue Management:** Log DQ failures as defects in Jira/ADO, assign to Data Stewards for triage and relevant DE/Source System team for remediation. Track resolution.</li>

             <div class="implementation-detail">
                <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                <ol>
                   <li>**Identify Critical Paths:** Determine key data pipelines (e.g., GPS stream processing -> real-time location update) and critical analytical queries/reports with performance NFRs (throughput, latency).</li>
                   <li>**Define Performance NFRs:** Set specific, measurable targets (e.g., GPS end-to-end latency P99 < 10 seconds, Daily reporting ETL must complete within 1 hour, Dashboard load time < 5 seconds).</li>
                   <li>**Environment Setup:** Use the dedicated, production-scaled PERF environment. Ensure realistic, anonymized data volumes representative of peak load.</li>
                   <li>**Test Script Development:**
                       <ul>
                           <li>**Pipeline Load:** Use tools (e.g., Kinesis Data Generator, custom Python scripts, JMeter feeding API Gateway) to generate realistic high-volume streaming or batch input data.</li>
                           <li>**Query/Report Load:** Use tools (e.g., Apache Bench, JMeter, custom scripts using DB drivers/QuickSight API) to simulate concurrent user queries against Redshift/Athena/QuickSight dashboards.</li>
                       </ul>
                   </li>
                    <li>**Execution & Monitoring:** Run performance test scripts against the PERF environment while closely monitoring relevant system metrics (CloudWatch, Redshift/DB metrics, Glue job metrics, Lambda metrics).</li>
                    <li>**Analysis:** Analyze results against NFRs. Identify bottlenecks (e.g., insufficient Kinesis shards, under-provisioned Redshift capacity, inefficient SQL queries, Lambda timeouts, slow ETL transformations). Use CloudWatch, X-Ray, DB performance insights tools.</li>
                    <li>**Optimization & Retesting:** Work with DE/DBA/Dev teams to implement optimizations (tune queries, adjust partitioning/distribution keys, scale resources, refactor code). Rerun tests to verify improvement.</li>
                    <li>**Gating:** Include performance test execution and result validation as a mandatory step/quality gate before major production releases impacting critical data paths.</li>
                </ol>
                 <p class="tool-note">Tools: k6, JMeter, Gatling, Kinesis Data Generator, Custom Scripts, CloudWatch, Redshift Performance Dashboards, X-Ray, Athena Query Stats.</p>

            <h2>VI. Reporting, Visualization & Analytics Strategy (Expanded)</h2>
             <div class="section-description">
                <p>This section details the comprehensive strategy for transforming raw TMS data into actionable insights, delivered through intuitive reports and visualizations to the right stakeholders at the right time. It emphasizes a governed approach combining certified enterprise reporting with controlled self-service capabilities, underpinned by robust data quality and performance.</p>
    
                <h3>A. Reporting & Visualization Philosophy</h3>
                 <div class="subsection">
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Audience-Centric Design:** Reports and dashboards *must* be designed with the specific needs, context, and data literacy level of the target audience in mind. Avoid information overload; prioritize clarity and actionability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Storytelling:** Go beyond simply presenting data; structure reports and visualizations to tell a clear story, answer key business questions, highlight significant trends, and guide decision-making.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency & Standardization:** Utilize standard templates, color palettes (aligned with NYCPS branding), chart types, and terminology across all official reports and dashboards to ensure a consistent user experience and facilitate understanding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance First:** Dashboards and reports, especially operational ones, *must* load quickly and respond interactively. Performance considerations (data modeling, query tuning, caching) are integral to the design process.</li>
                        <li>**Governance & Trust:** Implement clear distinctions and processes for certified, centrally managed reports versus user-generated self-service analyses to maintain trust in official metrics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Actionability:** Reports should facilitate action, whether it's identifying operational issues, tracking progress against goals, informing strategic decisions, or demonstrating compliance. Include clear definitions, context, and potential next steps where appropriate.</li>
                     </ul>
                 </div>
    
                <h3>B. Reporting Tiers, Content & Tools (Detailed)</h3>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>We will implement the previously defined tiers with enhanced detail:</p>
                     <ul>

                                <li><strong>Audience:</strong> OPT Dispatchers, Routers, SRE/Ops, Support L1/L2, potentially School Admins (limited views).</li>
                                <li><strong>Content Examples:**
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Live Map: Bus locations (color-coded by status: on-time, delayed, off-route), route paths, traffic overlays.</li>
                                        <li>Route Status Board: List of active routes, current status (pending, in-progress, completed), next stop ETA, delay indicators, assigned driver/vehicle.</li>
                                        <li>Ridership Monitor: Real-time count of scanned boardings/alightings per route/school, absence alerts.</li>
                                        <li>Alert Feed: Critical operational alerts (bus breakdown, major delays, security alerts, geofence breaches).</li>
                                        <li>System Health Vitals: Core infrastructure metrics (API latency, error rates, queue depths).</li>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Key Characteristics:** High data freshness (seconds to minutes), highly interactive (filtering, zooming), focused on immediate action/awareness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Primary Tool:** **AWS QuickSight** dashboards utilizing **SPICE** datasets configured for frequent refresh (e.g., every 15 or 60 minutes, depending on data source latency and SPICE capacity/cost tradeoffs). Potentially supplement with direct CloudWatch Dashboards for pure infrastructure metrics or Grafana if needed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Implementation:** BI Developers build certified dashboards based on requirements from operational teams. Data sourced from operational databases (DynamoDB, RDS) and potentially Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time aggregation.</li>

                  <div class="subsection">
                     <div class="risk-note">WARNING: Use of Generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), carries significant risks in this context due to potential for hallucinations (generating incorrect information), data privacy leakage (if PII/Confidential data enters prompts or training data), bias amplification, security vulnerabilities, and high costs. Use MUST be extremely limited, rigorously governed, and approved only for low-risk, high-value internal applications with mandatory human oversight.</div>
                     <h4>1. Permissible Use Cases (Strictly Limited & Subject to Approval):</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>**Synthetic Data Generation (Anonymized):** Potential use of LLMs or specialized models to generate *realistic but entirely synthetic* (non-PII) data for testing purposes, *after* rigorous validation of its non-identifiability and representativeness. Requires expert oversight.</li>
                            <li>**Documentation Assistance:** Using LLMs to *draft* initial versions of technical documentation, runbooks, or KB articles based on existing resources (e.g., code comments, design docs). **Mandatory human review, editing, and verification required before finalization.**</li>
                            <li>**Report Summarization (Non-Sensitive Data Only):** Potential use to summarize *aggregated, non-sensitive, non-PII* operational reports or incident post-mortem findings *after* human review and redaction of any sensitive details.</li>
                            <li>**Internal Knowledge Q&A (Highly Controlled RAG):** Potential development of an internal chatbot for *project team members only* to query *approved, non-sensitive* project documentation (Confluence pages, technical docs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). **Strict controls needed:** Must run entirely within secure GovCloud environment, use approved models (see below), ensure no PII enters prompts/logs, implement strong access controls, and clearly label outputs as AI-generated and potentially imperfect.</li>
                        </ul>
                     <h4>2. Prohibited Use Cases (Non-Negotiable):</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>**Direct interaction with PII/MNPI/Confidential Student Data:** No GenAI model should process or generate outputs based on raw sensitive data.</li>
                            <li>**Automated Decision Making:** GenAI *must not* make operational decisions (e.g., route changes, student assignments, incident resolution actions). Human oversight and decision-making are mandatory.</li>
                            <li>**External-Facing Chatbots/Interfaces:** No GenAI interfaces directly exposed to parents, students, or the public.</li>
                            <li>**Code Generation for Production:** While LLMs can assist developers, generated code *must* undergo the same rigorous review, testing, and security scanning as human-written code. It cannot be deployed directly.</li>
                            <li>**Training/Fine-tuning on NYCPS Data:** Unless explicitly approved under a separate, highly governed protocol involving anonymization and legal/privacy/security sign-off, NYCPS data *must not* be used to fine-tune foundation models.</li>
                        </ul>
                     <h4>3. Governance & Implementation (Mandatory Controls):</h4>
                     <ol>
                        <li>**Formal Approval Required:** Any proposed use of GenAI requires a formal proposal detailing the use case, data involved (proving no PII), model chosen, security controls, ethical review, and risk assessment, submitted to and approved by the **AI Ethics Review Group, CISO, CPO, and potentially Legal Counsel.**</li>
                        <li>**Approved Models & Platforms:** Use only approved foundation models available through secure AWS GovCloud services like **Amazon Bedrock** or **SageMaker JumpStart** (subject to availability and approval within GovCloud). Avoid direct calls to external, commercial LLM APIs outside the secure boundary.</li>
                        <li>**Data Handling:** Implement strict technical controls (e.g., prompt filtering, data masking gateways) to prevent PII/Confidential data from ever reaching the GenAI model endpoints or being logged.</li>
                        <li>**Secure Infrastructure:** Deploy any custom GenAI applications (like RAG systems) within the secure TMS VPC infrastructure following all standard security practices (private subnets, IAM least privilege, encryption).</li>
                        <li>**Human Review & Oversight:** *Mandatory* human review and verification required for *all* outputs generated by GenAI before they are used or published (documentation drafts, report summaries, synthetic data validation).</li>
                        <li>**Logging & Auditing:** Log all prompts sent to and responses received from GenAI models (ensuring no PII is logged). Audit usage patterns.</li>
                        <li>**User Training:** Train users on the approved uses, limitations, risks, and responsibilities when interacting with authorized internal GenAI tools.</li>

                        <li>**AI Ethics Review Group:** Maintain the cross-functional group established during Use Case Identification.</li>
                        <li>**Mandatory Ethical Review:** Conduct formal ethical reviews (documented in Confluence) for *all* ML/AI models *before* production deployment, assessing potential bias, fairness implications across demographics (using SageMaker Clarify/Fairlearn), transparency needs, and societal impact.</li>
                        <li>**Bias Mitigation Strategies:** If bias is detected, implement mitigation techniques (e.g., data re-sampling/re-weighting during preprocessing, applying fairness constraints during training, post-processing adjustments) and document the approach and results. Re-evaluate fairness post-mitigation.</li>
                        <li>**Explainability:** For high-impact models (e.g., potentially influencing route assignments even indirectly), prioritize models with higher inherent interpretability or utilize post-hoc explanation techniques (SHAP, LIME via SageMaker Clarify) to understand feature importance. Document explanations.</li>
                        <li>**Human Oversight:** Ensure critical decisions influenced by AI/ML outputs always have a human-in-the-loop for review and final decision-making, especially where safety or equity is concerned.</li>
                        <li>**Transparency:** Document model purpose, limitations, key features driving predictions, and fairness metrics clearly for relevant stakeholders (e.g., OPT management reviewing model performance).</li>
