    <h1>NYCPS TMS: Prescriptive Cloud Cost Management & FinOps Strategy</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro-finops">
        <h2>I. Introduction: The Financial Imperative in the Cloud</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>This document mandates the comprehensive, hyper-detailed Cloud Cost Management and Financial Operations (FinOps) strategy for the NYCPS Transportation Management System (TMS) project. Operating a large-scale, data-intensive system on AWS GovCloud requires a disciplined, proactive approach to managing expenditures to ensure fiscal responsibility, maximize the value derived from cloud investments, maintain budget predictability, and meet the stringent accountability standards expected in a public sector project.</p>
            <p>This strategy integrates financial governance, cost visibility, accurate forecasting, continuous optimization, and transparent reporting into the daily operations and development lifecycle. It explicitly expands upon the overall project Financial Management Plan, providing granular detail on *how* cloud-specific costs will be meticulously tracked, analyzed, controlled, and optimized.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Objective:</strong> To instill a culture of cost awareness and accountability across all teams interacting with cloud resources, enabling data-driven decisions that balance performance, security, compliance, and cost-effectiveness throughout the TMS lifecycle.</p>
            <div class="principle-box">
                 <h4>Core FinOps Principles (Mandatory Adherence):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visibility is Foundational:** We cannot manage what we cannot see. Implement comprehensive cost visibility and allocation mechanisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability Drives Action:** Teams responsible for building and running services are accountable for their cloud consumption and empowered to optimize it.</li>
                    <li>**Collaboration is Key:** FinOps requires collaboration between Finance, Engineering (Dev, Ops, SRE), Security, and Project Management/Leadership.</li>
                    <li>**Decisions are Data-Driven:** Use accurate cost and usage data to inform architectural choices, optimization efforts, and budget forecasts.</li>
                    <li>**Cloud Native Optimization:** Leverage cloud pricing models (RIs, SPs), elasticity, managed services, and specific AWS cost-saving features proactively.</li>
                    <li>**Proactive Governance:** Establish automated guardrails and review processes to prevent cost anomalies and enforce policies.</li>
                    <li>**Continuous Optimization:** Cost management is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Regularly review and refine resource usage and purchasing strategies.</li>
                </ul>
             </div>
        </div>

             <div class="implementation-detail">
                 <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Define a **Mandatory Tagging Policy** documented in Confluence, requiring specific tags on *all* taggable AWS resources provisioned via Terraform.</li>
                    <li>**Mandatory Tags:**
                        <ul>
                            <li>`environment`: (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `staging`, `perf`, `prod`, `mgmt`)</li>
                            <li>`project`: `nycps-tms` (Consistent identifier)</li>
                            <li>`service-component`: (Specific microservice or logical component name, e.g., `gps-ingestion`, `routing-engine`, `parent-api`, `data-lake-raw`)</li>
                            <li>`owner-team`: (Team responsible, e.g., `apollo-dev`, `platform-sre`, `data-eng`)</li>
                            <li>`cost-center`: (Link to NYCPS financial cost center, provided by Finance Liaison - essential for potential showback/chargeback)</li>
                            <li>*(Optional but Recommended)* `feature-id`: (Link to Jira Epic/Feature for new initiatives)</li>
                            <li>*(Optional)* `created-by`: (`terraform` or user/pipeline identifier)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Implementation via Terraform:**
                        <ul>
                           <li>Configure default tags in the AWS provider block within each environment's `main.tf` (e.g., setting `environment`, `project`).</li>
                           <li>Mandate passing `service-component`, `owner-team`, `cost-center` variables into reusable modules and applying them to all resources created by the module.</li>
                           <li>Conduct code reviews on Terraform MRs specifically checking for correct tag application.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Enforcement & Governance:**
                        <ul>
                           <li>Implement **AWS Config** custom rules (deployed via Terraform) to detect resources missing mandatory tags or having non-compliant tag values.</li>
                           <li>Configure Config rules to trigger non-compliance notifications (SNS -> Slack/Email) or potentially auto-remediation actions (e.g., stopping untagged non-prod instances after a grace period - use with caution).</li>
                           <li>Periodically review untagged resources report in AWS Tag Editor / Cost Explorer.</li>
                           <li>Establish a process (via Jira/Service Request) for requesting and approving new tag values (e.g., new cost centers, new service components).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Activate Tags for Cost Allocation:** In the AWS Billing console, explicitly activate the user-defined tags (`environment`, `service-component`, `owner-team`, `cost-center`) as **Cost Allocation Tags**. This makes them available for filtering and grouping in Cost Explorer and CUR. Allow ~24 hours for activation.</li>

                     <li>**Showback:** Distribute these reports regularly (e.g., monthly) to the owners of each cost center to provide visibility into the cloud resources consumed by their department/function related to TMS.</li>
                     <li>**Chargeback:** If formal internal billing is required by NYCPS finance, use the generated showback reports as the basis for internal cost allocation according to established NYCPS financial procedures. This requires close collaboration with the NYCPS Finance Liaison.</li>
                     <li>Clearly define how shared infrastructure costs (e.g., network backbone, shared services, security tools) are allocated across cost centers (e.g., based on usage proportion, fixed percentage).</li>

    <section id="optimization-lifecycle">
        <h2>VI. Continuous Cost Optimization Lifecycle</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
             <p>Optimization is an ongoing, iterative process involving multiple techniques applied systematically.</p>

            <h3>A. Right-Sizing Compute & Database Resources</h3>
             <div class="implementation-detail">
                 <h5>Process (Mandatory Monthly/Quarterly Review Cadence):</h5>
                 <ol>
                    <li>**Identify Candidates:** Use **AWS Cost Explorer Rightsizing Recommendations** (based on historical CloudWatch metrics) and **AWS Compute Optimizer** recommendations as primary inputs. Supplement with detailed CloudWatch metric analysis (CPU/Memory Utilization - Avg vs. Max) for key EC2, RDS, ECS/Fargate tasks, Lambda functions over a significant period (e.g., 14-30 days). Pay attention to resources with consistently low average utilization but occasional peaks.</li>
                    <li>**Analyze & Validate:** SRE/Ops/Dev teams review recommendations. **Do not blindly apply.** Consider workload characteristics (spiky vs. steady), memory vs. CPU constraints, burst requirements, and potential impact of downsizing on peak performance or SLOs. Use APM data (if available) for deeper application-level insights.</li>
                    <li>**Select Instance Family/Size:** Choose appropriate instance families (consider Graviton/ARM instances for better price/performance where compatible) and sizes based on analysis. For containers/Lambda, adjust CPU/Memory reservations/limits.</li>
                    <li>**Implement via IaC:** Modify instance types, task definitions, or Lambda configurations in Terraform code.</li>
                    <li>**Test:** Deploy changes first to non-production environments (QA/Staging). Conduct targeted performance tests and monitor application health after the change to validate no negative impact.</li>
                    <li>**Deploy to Production:** Roll out validated changes to production during a planned maintenance window using CI/CD pipeline (with necessary approvals).</li>
                    <li>**Monitor Post-Change:** Closely monitor performance and cost metrics after the change to confirm expected savings and ensure no performance degradation.</li>

              <div class="implementation-detail">
                 <h5>Process (Mandatory Quarterly Analysis Cadence):</h5>
                 <ol>
                    <li>**Analyze Usage:** Use **AWS Cost Explorer RI/SP Recommendations** and detailed CUR analysis to identify stable, long-term usage patterns for EC2, Fargate, Lambda, RDS, Redshift, OpenSearch, SageMaker that could benefit from commitment discounts.</li>
                    <li>**Evaluate Recommendations:** Analyze Cost Explorer's recommended purchases (service, instance family, region, term - 1yr vs 3yr, payment option - All/Partial/No Upfront). Consider flexibility needs (e.g., Convertible RIs or Compute Savings Plans offer more flexibility than Standard RIs). Model potential savings vs. commitment lock-in risk. Aim for a target coverage percentage (e.g., 70-90%) of stable baseline usage.</li>
                    <li>**Develop Purchase Proposal:** FinOps Lead/Analyst prepares a detailed proposal outlining recommended RI/SP purchases, projected savings, commitment term, upfront cost (if any), and associated risks.</li>
                    <li>**Obtain Approval:** Present proposal to project leadership and **NYCPS Finance/Steering Committee** for formal approval, especially for significant upfront payments or long-term commitments.</li>
                    <li>**Execute Purchase:** Once approved, execute the purchase via AWS Billing Console or API.</li>
                    <li>**Track Utilization & Coverage:** Continuously monitor RI/SP utilization and coverage rates using Cost Explorer RI/SP reports. Identify underutilized reservations and explore modifications/exchanges where possible (especially for Convertible RIs). Set alerts for expiring commitments to plan renewals.</li>

Implement/tune **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** configurations for buckets with unpredictable access patterns. Implement/verify **S3 Lifecycle Policies** (via Terraform) to automatically transition data to lower-cost tiers (Standard-IA -> Glacier Instant Retrieval -> Glacier Flexible Retrieval -> Glacier Deep Archive) based on age and access frequency, aligning with the 7-year retention requirement.</li>
                    <li>**EBS Volume Optimization:** Review EBS volume types (gp2 vs gp3 - gp3 often cheaper and more performant), resize underutilized volumes (identified via CloudWatch metrics), and delete unattached volumes or old snapshots. Use **AWS Backup lifecycle policies** or custom scripts to automatically delete EBS snapshots older than the required retention period.</li>
                    <li>**Database Storage:** Monitor RDS/DynamoDB storage growth. Archive historical data from active databases to S3 (as per Data Archival plan) to manage primary storage costs and performance.</li>
                    <li>**Log Retention:** Ensure CloudWatch Log Groups and other log storage mechanisms have appropriate retention periods configured (via Terraform) to avoid indefinite storage costs, balancing operational needs with compliance requirements.</li>

                 <ol>
                    <li>**Identify Targets:** Tag all non-production resources (EC2, RDS, potentially Fargate services, SageMaker Notebooks) eligible for shutdown during non-business hours (nights, weekends). Use a specific tag like `schedule: office-hours`.</li>
                    <li>**Implement Automation:** Deploy and configure the **AWS Instance Scheduler** solution OR develop custom Lambda functions triggered by **EventBridge Scheduler** rules.</li>
                    <li>**Configuration:** Define schedules (e.g., Stop at 8 PM EST Mon-Fri, Start at 7 AM EST Mon-Fri). Configure the automation to target resources based on the `schedule` tag. Ensure RDS instances are stopped correctly (which automatically creates a final snapshot).</li>
                    <li>**Exclusions:** Provide a mechanism (e.g., another tag `schedule-exempt: true`) to exclude specific non-prod resources needed for overnight batch jobs or testing.</li>
                    <li>**Monitoring:** Monitor the execution of the scheduler jobs/Lambdas. Set alerts if shutdown/startup fails. Periodically review if resources are being correctly stopped/started.</li>

        <h2>IX. Conclusion: Embedding Fiscal Responsibility in Cloud Operations</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>This Cloud Cost Management and FinOps Strategy provides the essential framework for ensuring fiscal discipline and maximizing the value of the significant AWS GovCloud investment required for the NYCPS TMS project. By establishing clear governance, mandating granular visibility through rigorous tagging and CUR analysis, implementing proactive budgeting and forecasting integrated with AWS tools, executing a continuous optimization lifecycle across multiple dimensions (right-sizing, purchase models, storage, scheduling), and fostering a culture of cost accountability through transparent reporting and communication, we embed financial responsibility directly into our engineering and operational practices.</p>
            <p>Strict adherence to this prescriptive plan, particularly the emphasis on automation (tagging enforcement, non-prod scheduling, budget alerts, data collection) and data-driven decision-making, is critical for maintaining budget control, justifying expenditures, achieving cost efficiencies, and ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of this vital system for NYCPS.</p>
