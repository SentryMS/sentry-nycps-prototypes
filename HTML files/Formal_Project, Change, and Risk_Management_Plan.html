    <h1>NYCPS TMS: Formal Change & Risk Management Plan</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>I. Introduction & Integration with Agile/DevOps</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>This document defines the formal Change Management and Risk Management processes supplementing the core Agile (Scrum) and DevSecOps practices for the NYCPS Transportation Management System (TMS) project. While Agile methodologies embrace iterative refinement within sprints based on feedback and backlog grooming, the scale, complexity, contractual nature, and public sector context of this project necessitate a formal structure for managing significant changes to baselined scope, schedule, or budget, and for proactively managing project risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Integration Principle:</strong> These formal processes are designed to work *with*, not against, the Agile workflow. They provide a framework for control and accountability for substantial deviations or potential threats, while day-to-day development and refinement continue within the sprint cadence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Approved Change Requests (CRs) translate into prioritized Epics/Features/User Stories within the Product Backlog.</li>
                <li>Risk Mitigation actions become tasks within the Sprint Backlog.</li>
                <li>Regular Agile ceremonies (Reviews, Retrospectives, Grooming) serve as inputs for identifying potential changes and risks.</li>
                <li>Automation via Jira/ADO and Confluence streamlines tracking and reporting for both Agile execution and formal PM processes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Adherence to these Change and Risk Management procedures is mandatory for all project team members and stakeholders to ensure controlled execution, transparency, and successful delivery against commitments.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Governance Context -->
    <section id="governance-context">
         <h2>II. Governance Context for Change & Risk</h2>
         <div class="section-description">
             <p>The effectiveness of these plans relies on the established project governance structure. Key bodies involved include:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Project Managers (Vendor & NYCPS):</strong> Co-manage day-to-day execution, facilitate processes, perform initial CR/Risk assessment, prepare reports.</li>
                 <li><strong>Product Owner(s) (NYCPS):</strong> Owns the Product Backlog, key decision-maker for functional scope changes within Agile framework, provides input on CR impact/value.</li>
                 <li><strong>Change Control Board (CCB):</strong> Formal body (membership defined: e.g., PMs, PO, Key Tech Leads, Sponsor Rep) responsible for reviewing and approving/rejecting significant Change Requests impacting baseline scope, schedule, or cost. Meets regularly (e.g., bi-weekly) or ad-hoc as needed.</li>
                 <li><strong>Technical Review Board (TRB):</strong> Reviews technical impact of changes, assesses technical risks.</li>
                 <li><strong>Security Review Board (SRB):</strong> Reviews security implications of changes, assesses security risks.</li>
                 <li><strong>Steering Committee:</strong> Provides highest-level oversight, resolves escalated risks/issues, approves major strategic changes or budget adjustments recommended by the CCB.</li>
             </ul>
         </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Change Management Plan -->
    <section id="change-management">
        <h2>III. Detailed Change Management Plan</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <h3>A. Purpose & Scope</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a structured, documented, and controlled process for managing requests to change the agreed-upon project scope, schedule, cost, or technical approach *after* the initial requirements baseline for a major phase or release has been formally approved (typically post Phase 1 requirements sign-off).</p>
                <p><strong>Scope - What Requires a Formal Change Request (CR):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requests for significant new features or functionality not included in the baselined requirements for the current or upcoming planned release/phase.</li>
                    <li>Changes that materially impact the project schedule (e.g., delay a major milestone by more than one sprint) or budget (e.g., require additional resources or licenses).</li>
                    <li>Changes impacting contractual obligations or deliverables.</li>
                    <li>Significant alterations to the approved technical architecture or core security controls.</li>
                    <li>Changes requested by NYCPS stakeholders *after* UAT sign-off for a specific release increment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Out of Scope (Handled via Agile Backlog Management):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clarifications or refinements of existing user stories during backlog grooming or sprint execution.</li>
                    <li>Bug fixes for implemented functionality (managed via defect tracking).</li>
                    <li>Minor technical implementation details decided by the development team that do not impact external interfaces, NFRs, or overall architecture.</li>
                    <li>Reprioritization of *existing* backlog items by the Product Owner (unless it significantly impacts major milestones requiring CCB notification).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>B. Change Request (CR) Workflow & Process Steps</h3>
             <div class="subsection">
                 <ol>
                     <li>
                         <strong>Step 1: CR Initiation & Submission</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>Any project stakeholder (Vendor team member, NYCPS stakeholder) identifies a potential need for change that falls within the scope defined above.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                            <li>Requestor creates a new issue of type "Change Request" in the project's Jira/ADO board.</li>
                            <li>Requestor completes the mandatory fields defined in the **Change Request Form Template** (see below). This includes a clear description, strong justification/business value, requestor details, date, and initial thoughts on impact/priority.</li>
                            <li>Attach any supporting documentation (e.g., mockups, requirement documents).</li>
                         </ol>
                         <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Any Stakeholder (Initiation), Requestor (Documentation).</p>
                     </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Step 2: CR Logging & Initial Assessment</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>The Project Manager (or designated Change Manager) reviews the submitted CR for completeness and logs it formally.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                             <li>Project Manager reviews the submitted Jira ticket for clarity and required information within 1-2 business days.</li>
                             <li>If incomplete, PM requests clarification from the Requestor via Jira comments.</li>
                             <li>If complete, PM assigns a unique CR ID (can be the Jira key), updates the status to "Under Assessment", and adds it to the central Change Register (maintained as a Jira Filter/Dashboard and potentially summarized on a Confluence page).</li>
                             <li>PM performs a quick initial assessment: Does this clearly require CCB review, or could it potentially be addressed as a backlog refinement/bug? Assigns initial priority estimate.</li>
                         </ol>
                          <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Project Manager.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Step 3: Detailed Impact Assessment</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>Relevant Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) conduct a thorough analysis of the proposed change's impact across multiple dimensions.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                            <li>PM assigns assessment tasks to relevant SMEs via linked Jira tasks or comments (e.g., Tech Lead for technical feasibility/effort, QA Lead for testing impact, Security Architect for security implications, PO for value/priority reassessment, PM for schedule/cost).</li>
                            <li>SMEs perform analysis within an agreed timeframe (e.g., 3-5 business days).</li>
                            <li>SMEs document their findings using the **Impact Assessment Template** (see below), typically on a linked Confluence page or within dedicated Jira custom fields. Analysis must cover:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Scope:** How does this change functionality? What other areas/stories are affected?</li>
                                    <li>**Schedule:** Estimated effort (e.g., Story Points, Person-Days), impact on current sprint, impact on major milestones/release dates.</li>
                                    <li>**Cost:** Additional resource needs, software/licensing costs, AWS GovCloud cost implications.</li>
                                    <li>**Technical:** Feasibility, architectural impact, complexity, impact on performance/scalability/reliability.</li>
                                    <li>**Testing:** Additional testing required (automated/manual), impact on existing test suites.</li>
                                    <li>**Security:** Potential new vulnerabilities, impact on existing controls, compliance implications.</li>
                                    <li>**Risk:** New risks introduced, impact on existing risks.</li>
                                    <li>**Dependencies:** Impact on or from other teams/systems/features.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                         </ol>
                         <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Assigned SMEs (Tech Lead, QA Lead, Sec Lead, PO, PM, Arch, etc.).</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Step 4: PM Review & Recommendation</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>The Project Manager consolidates the impact assessment and formulates a recommendation for the CCB.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                             <li>PM reviews the completed impact assessments for thoroughness and consistency.</li>
                             <li>PM synthesizes the findings into a summary.</li>
                             <li>PM develops a formal recommendation: Approve, Reject, Defer, or Request More Information, including rationale based on the impact analysis vs. the original justification/value.</li>
                             <li>PM updates the CR status in Jira/ADO to "Ready for CCB Review" and adds it to the agenda for the next CCB meeting.</li>
                         </ol>
                         <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Project Manager.</p>
                     </li>

                         <strong>Step 5: Change Control Board (CCB) Review & Decision</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>The formally constituted CCB reviews the CR, impact assessment, and recommendation to make a final, documented decision.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                             <li>CCB meeting held at regular cadence (e.g., bi-weekly) or convened ad-hoc for urgent requests. Agenda circulated beforehand.</li>
                             <li>PM or Requestor presents the CR, justification, and summary of impact assessment.</li>
                             <li>SMEs present details of impact assessment as needed.</li>
                             <li>CCB discusses benefits, costs, risks, and alignment with project goals/constraints.</li>
                             <li>CCB makes a formal decision:
                                 <ul>
                                     <li>**Approved:** Change proceeds to implementation.</li>
                                     <li>**Approved with Conditions:** Change proceeds but specific conditions must be met.</li>
                                     <li>**Rejected:** Change will not be implemented. Rationale documented.</li>
                                     <li>**Deferred:** Decision postponed pending more information or strategic timing. CR placed on hold.</li>
                                     <li>**More Information Required:** CR returned to Impact Assessment stage with specific questions.</li>

            <h3>A. Purpose & Scope</h3>
             <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To systematically identify, analyze, plan responses for, monitor, and control potential events or conditions (risks) that could negatively impact the successful achievement of the NYCPS TMS project objectives (scope, schedule, budget, quality, security, stakeholder satisfaction).</p>
                <p><strong>Scope:</strong> This plan covers all phases of the project lifecycle, from initiation through operations. Risks can be internal (e.g., technical challenges, resource constraints, process failures) or external (e.g., changing regulations, vendor dependencies, infrastructure outages).</p>

                            <li><strong>Initial Risk Workshop:</strong> Conduct a dedicated workshop early in the project (Phase 1) with key stakeholders (PMs, Leads, PO, OPT/DIIT SMEs, Security) using brainstorming techniques.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ongoing Identification Techniques:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Checklist Analysis:** Use checklists based on common project risks, AWS GovCloud considerations, complex system integrations, and past NYCPS project lessons learned.</li>
                                    <li>**Assumption Analysis:** Review key project assumptions and identify risks if assumptions prove false.</li>
                                    <li>**SWOT Analysis:** Periodically analyze Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats related to the project.</li>
                                    <li>**Agile Ceremonies:** Encourage risk identification during Daily Stand-ups (impediments), Sprint Reviews (feedback indicating unmet needs), Sprint Retrospectives (process issues), and Backlog Grooming (unclear requirements).</li>
                                    <li>**Expert Interviews:** Discuss potential risks with technical architects, security specialists, and domain experts.</li>

                            <li>Calculate **Risk Score/Level:** Use a Probability/Impact (PxI) Matrix (see template below) to determine the overall risk level (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on P and I ratings. Store P, I, and Score/Level in Jira custom fields.</li>
                            <li>Prioritize risks based on their Score/Level for response planning.</li>

         <h2>V. Integrating Formal PM with Agile/DevOps</h2>
         <div class="section-description">
            <p>These formal Change and Risk Management processes are designed to overlay, not replace, the Agile framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Change vs. Backlog:** The CCB handles changes *to the baseline*. The Product Owner manages priority and refinement *within* the baseline via the backlog. Small adjustments or clarifications identified during grooming are typically *not* formal CRs. Significant deviations emerging from grooming *should* trigger a CR.</li>
                <li>**Risk Actions in Sprints:** Mitigation or contingency actions identified in the Risk Plan become concrete tasks or User Stories in the Product Backlog, prioritized by the PO alongside features. The work gets done within sprints.</li>
                <li>**Transparency:** Jira/ADO serves as the central hub. CRs and Risks are issue types alongside User Stories and Bugs, providing integrated visibility on project boards and dashboards.</li>
                <li>**Cadence Alignment:** CCB meetings and Risk reviews are scheduled to align with sprint cadences and MBR reporting cycles, ensuring timely information flow.</li>
                <li>**Focus:** Agile focuses on *delivering value iteratively within defined boundaries*. Formal PM focuses on *managing changes to those boundaries* and *proactively addressing threats* to achieving the overall objectives.</li>
