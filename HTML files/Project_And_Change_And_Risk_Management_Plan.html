    <h1>NYCPS TMS: Formal Change & Risk Management Plan</h1>

    <!-- Introduction & Integration -->
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>I. Introduction & Integration with Agile/DevOps</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>This document defines the formal Change Management and Risk Management processes supplementing the core Agile (Scrum) and DevSecOps practices for the NYCPS Transportation Management System (TMS) project. While Agile methodologies embrace iterative refinement within sprints based on feedback and backlog grooming, the scale, complexity, contractual nature, and public sector context of this project necessitate a formal structure for managing significant changes to baselined scope, schedule, or budget, and for proactively managing project risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Integration Principle:</strong> These formal processes are designed to work *with*, not against, the Agile workflow. They provide a framework for control and accountability for substantial deviations or potential threats, while day-to-day development and refinement continue within the sprint cadence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Approved Change Requests (CRs) translate into prioritized Epics/Features/User Stories within the Product Backlog.</li>
                <li>Risk Mitigation actions become tasks within the Sprint Backlog.</li>
                <li>Regular Agile ceremonies (Reviews, Retrospectives, Grooming) serve as inputs for identifying potential changes and risks.</li>
                <li>Automation via Jira/ADO and Confluence streamlines tracking and reporting for both Agile execution and formal PM processes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Adherence to these Change and Risk Management procedures is mandatory for all project team members and stakeholders to ensure controlled execution, transparency, and successful delivery against commitments.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Governance Context -->
    <section id="governance-context">
         <h2>II. Governance Context for Change & Risk</h2>
         <div class="section-description">
             <p>The effectiveness of these plans relies on the established project governance structure. Key bodies involved include:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Project Managers (Vendor & NYCPS):</strong> Co-manage day-to-day execution, facilitate processes, perform initial CR/Risk assessment, prepare reports.</li>
                 <li><strong>Product Owner(s) (NYCPS):</strong> Owns the Product Backlog, key decision-maker for functional scope changes within Agile framework, provides input on CR impact/value.</li>
                 <li><strong>Change Control Board (CCB):</strong> Formal body (membership defined: e.g., PMs, PO, Key Tech Leads, Sponsor Rep) responsible for reviewing and approving/rejecting significant Change Requests impacting baseline scope, schedule, or cost. Meets regularly (e.g., bi-weekly) or ad-hoc as needed.</li>
                 <li><strong>Technical Review Board (TRB):</strong> Reviews technical impact of changes, assesses technical risks.</li>
                 <li><strong>Security Review Board (SRB):</strong> Reviews security implications of changes, assesses security risks.</li>
                 <li><strong>Steering Committee:</strong> Provides highest-level oversight, resolves escalated risks/issues, approves major strategic changes or budget adjustments recommended by the CCB.</li>
             </ul>
         </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Change Management Plan -->
    <section id="change-management">
        <h2>III. Detailed Change Management Plan</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <h3>A. Purpose & Scope</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a structured, documented, and controlled process for managing requests to change the agreed-upon project scope, schedule, cost, or technical approach *after* the initial requirements baseline for a major phase or release has been formally approved (typically post Phase 1 requirements sign-off).</p>
                <p><strong>Scope - What Requires a Formal Change Request (CR):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requests for significant new features or functionality not included in the baselined requirements for the current or upcoming planned release/phase.</li>
                    <li>Changes that materially impact the project schedule (e.g., delay a major milestone by more than one sprint) or budget (e.g., require additional resources or licenses).</li>
                    <li>Changes impacting contractual obligations or deliverables.</li>
                    <li>Significant alterations to the approved technical architecture or core security controls.</li>
                    <li>Changes requested by NYCPS stakeholders *after* UAT sign-off for a specific release increment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Out of Scope (Handled via Agile Backlog Management):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clarifications or refinements of existing user stories during backlog grooming or sprint execution.</li>
                    <li>Bug fixes for implemented functionality (managed via defect tracking).</li>
                    <li>Minor technical implementation details decided by the development team that do not impact external interfaces, NFRs, or overall architecture.</li>
                    <li>Reprioritization of *existing* backlog items by the Product Owner (unless it significantly impacts major milestones requiring CCB notification).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>B. Change Request (CR) Workflow & Process Steps</h3>
             <div class="subsection">
                 <ol>
                     <li>
                         <strong>Step 1: CR Initiation & Submission</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>Any project stakeholder (Vendor team member, NYCPS stakeholder) identifies a potential need for change that falls within the scope defined above.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                            <li>Requestor creates a new issue of type "Change Request" in the project's Jira/ADO board.</li>
                            <li>Requestor completes the mandatory fields defined in the **Change Request Form Template** (see below). This includes a clear description, strong justification/business value, requestor details, date, and initial thoughts on impact/priority.</li>
                            <li>Attach any supporting documentation (e.g., mockups, requirement documents).</li>
                         </ol>
                         <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Any Stakeholder (Initiation), Requestor (Documentation).</p>
                     </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Step 2: CR Logging & Initial Assessment</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>The Project Manager (or designated Change Manager) reviews the submitted CR for completeness and logs it formally.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                             <li>Project Manager reviews the submitted Jira ticket for clarity and required information within 1-2 business days.</li>
                             <li>If incomplete, PM requests clarification from the Requestor via Jira comments.</li>
                             <li>If complete, PM assigns a unique CR ID (can be the Jira key), updates the status to "Under Assessment", and adds it to the central Change Register (maintained as a Jira Filter/Dashboard and potentially summarized on a Confluence page).</li>
                             <li>PM performs a quick initial assessment: Does this clearly require CCB review, or could it potentially be addressed as a backlog refinement/bug? Assigns initial priority estimate.</li>
                         </ol>
                          <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Project Manager.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Step 3: Detailed Impact Assessment</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>Relevant Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) conduct a thorough analysis of the proposed change's impact across multiple dimensions.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                            <li>PM assigns assessment tasks to relevant SMEs via linked Jira tasks or comments (e.g., Tech Lead for technical feasibility/effort, QA Lead for testing impact, Security Architect for security implications, PO for value/priority reassessment, PM for schedule/cost).</li>
                            <li>SMEs perform analysis within an agreed timeframe (e.g., 3-5 business days).</li>
                            <li>SMEs document their findings using the **Impact Assessment Template** (see below), typically on a linked Confluence page or within dedicated Jira custom fields. Analysis must cover:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Scope:** How does this change functionality? What other areas/stories are affected?</li>
                                    <li>**Schedule:** Estimated effort (e.g., Story Points, Person-Days), impact on current sprint, impact on major milestones/release dates.</li>
                                    <li>**Cost:** Additional resource needs, software/licensing costs, AWS GovCloud cost implications.</li>
                                    <li>**Technical:** Feasibility, architectural impact, complexity, impact on performance/scalability/reliability.</li>
                                    <li>**Testing:** Additional testing required (automated/manual), impact on existing test suites.</li>
                                    <li>**Security:** Potential new vulnerabilities, impact on existing controls, compliance implications.</li>
                                    <li>**Risk:** New risks introduced, impact on existing risks.</li>
                                    <li>**Dependencies:** Impact on or from other teams/systems/features.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Step 4: PM Review & Recommendation</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>The Project Manager consolidates the impact assessment and formulates a recommendation for the CCB.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                             <li>PM reviews the completed impact assessments for thoroughness and consistency.</li>
                             <li>PM synthesizes the findings into a summary.</li>
                             <li>PM develops a formal recommendation: Approve, Reject, Defer, or Request More Information, including rationale based on the impact analysis vs. the original justification/value.</li>
                             <li>PM updates the CR status in Jira/ADO to "Ready for CCB Review" and adds it to the agenda for the next CCB meeting.</li>
                         </ol>
                         <p class="responsibility">Responsibility: Project Manager.</p>

                         <strong>Step 5: Change Control Board (CCB) Review & Decision</strong>
                         <h5>Description:</h5>
                         <p>The formally constituted CCB reviews the CR, impact assessment, and recommendation to make a final, documented decision.</p>
                         <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                         <ol>
                             <li>CCB meeting held at regular cadence (e.g., bi-weekly) or convened ad-hoc for urgent requests. Agenda circulated beforehand.</li>
                             <li>PM or Requestor presents the CR, justification, and summary of impact assessment.</li>
                             <li>SMEs present details of impact assessment as needed.</li>
                             <li>CCB discusses benefits, costs, risks, and alignment with project goals/constraints.</li>
                             <li>CCB makes a formal decision:
                                 <ul>
                                     <li>**Approved:** Change proceeds to implementation.</li>
                                     <li>**Approved with Conditions:** Change proceeds but specific conditions must be met.</li>
                                     <li>**Rejected:** Change will not be implemented. Rationale documented.</li>
                                     <li>**Deferred:** Decision postponed pending more information or strategic timing. CR placed on hold.</li>
                                     <li>**More Information Required:** CR returned to Impact Assessment stage with specific questions.</li>

        <h2>IV. Detailed Risk Management Plan (Enhanced & Prescriptive)</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <h3>A. Purpose, Scope & Philosophy</h3>
             <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To establish and mandate a systematic, proactive, documented, and continuously monitored process for identifying, analyzing, planning responses to, tracking, and controlling potential events or conditions (risks) that could negatively impact the successful achievement of the NYCPS TMS project objectives. Our objective is not just to react to risks, but to anticipate and manage them proactively to ensure project success within scope, schedule, budget, quality, security, and compliance constraints.</p>
                <p><strong>Scope:</strong> This comprehensive plan applies to all project phases, from initiation through deployment and into operations. It covers all categories of risk, including technical, operational, organizational, external dependencies, vendor-related, security, compliance, financial, schedule, and stakeholder-related risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Philosophy (Conservative & Proactive):</strong> Given the critical public sector nature of this project, our risk management philosophy is inherently conservative. We will prioritize thorough identification, assume risks are potentially higher impact until proven otherwise, favor proactive mitigation over acceptance where feasible, maintain meticulous documentation, and ensure clear communication and escalation pathways. Risk management is an ongoing, integrated activity for the *entire* project team and key stakeholders.</p>
             </div>

            <h3>B. Risk Management Methodology & Process Steps</h3>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Step 1: Risk Identification (Continuous & Exhaustive)</strong>
                        <h5>Description:</h5>
                        <p>This stage involves the systematic and ongoing effort to identify any potential risk that could affect the project. We will employ multiple techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>
                        <h5>Implementation How-To:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Formal Identification Sessions:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Initial Risk Workshop (Phase 1):</strong> Mandatory, facilitated session with core project team (PMs, Leads, Arch, Sec, QA, PO) and key NYCPS stakeholders (OPT, DIIT SMEs). Use brainstorming, SWOT, review of similar project lessons learned. Output populates the initial Risk Register.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Phase-Based Risk Reviews:</strong> Dedicated risk identification sessions held at the beginning of major project phases (e.g., before starting complex integrations, before UAT planning).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Feature-Specific Risk Assessment:</strong> For complex or high-impact features/epics, conduct mini-risk assessments during design/grooming.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous Identification Techniques:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Checklist Analysis:** Maintain and utilize project-specific checklists covering common risk areas (Technology - AWS GovCloud specifics, new tech adoption; Integration - complexity, vendor dependency; Resources - skill gaps, availability; Schedule - dependencies, estimation accuracy; Scope Creep; Security - vulnerabilities, compliance gaps; External - regulatory changes, SBC readiness). <strong>Checklist stored in Confluence, reviewed quarterly.</strong></li>
                                    <li>**Assumption & Constraint Analysis:** Document all key project assumptions and constraints. Regularly review them and identify risks associated with them proving invalid. Stored in Confluence.</li>
                                    <li>**Agile Ceremony Input:** Actively solicit potential risks during Daily Stand-ups (blockers often indicate risks), Sprint Reviews (feedback may reveal risks), Retrospectives (process issues are risks), and Backlog Grooming (ambiguity is a risk). Scrum Masters are responsible for facilitating this.</li>
                                    <li>**Expert Judgment & Interviews:** Regularly consult internal/external SMEs (Cloud Architects, Security Specialists, GIS Experts, experienced OPT personnel) specifically asking about potential risks in their domain.</li>
                                    <li>**Document Review:** Systematically review RFP, SOWs, Design Documents, Test Plans, Contracts, and Compliance requirements for potential risks.</li>
                                    <li>**Trend Analysis:** Monitor project metrics (velocity fluctuations, defect trends, CI/CD failures) for patterns indicating underlying risks.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>**Mandatory Logging:** Any potential risk identified through any channel *must* be logged immediately by the identifier (or reported to PM/Scrum Master for logging) in the central **Risk Register (Jira/ADO)**.</li>
                                    <li>**Required Information:** Use the "Risk" issue type with standardized fields (see Section IV.C). Initial entry requires at minimum: Clear Risk Title, Detailed Description (Cause-Risk-Effect), Date Identified, Identified By, Initial Perceived Priority/Impact.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <ol>
                            <li>For *every* Critical and High risk, and selected Medium risks, the assigned **Risk Owner** (designated SME or Lead) develops a detailed response plan documented in Jira/Confluence.</li>
                            <li>Select primary strategy (document rationale):
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Avoid:** Change the project plan to eliminate the threat entirely (requires CCB approval if baseline impacted). E.g., Choose different AWS service, remove complex feature.</li>
                                    <li>**Mitigate:** Actions to reduce Probability and/or Impact. E.g., Implement additional testing (specify *what* testing), add redundancy (specify *how*), conduct security training (specify *content/audience*), perform technical spike/prototype *early*, increase monitoring (specify *metrics*). **Most common strategy.**</li>
                                    <li>**Transfer:** Shift impact/ownership to a third party (e.g., enhanced warranty/SLA with hardware supplier, specific cyber insurance coverage - Requires Legal/Contract review). Document contractual basis.</li>
                                    <li>**Accept (Active vs. Passive):**
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>**Active Acceptance:** No immediate mitigation, but develop a **Detailed Contingency Plan** outlining specific step-by-step actions, required resources, communication steps, and decision points to execute *if* the risk occurs. Define clear, measurable **trigger conditions** for activating the contingency plan (e.g., "If integration test failure rate exceeds X% for Y hours"). May involve setting aside pre-approved schedule/budget contingency reserves. Requires documented approval from PM/Steering Committee.</li>
                                            <li>**Passive Acceptance:** Take no action, acknowledge the risk. Only acceptable for documented Low risks after review by PM.</li>

                            <li>**Contingency Plan Documentation:** Store detailed contingency plans in Confluence, linked to the Risk ticket. Ensure plans are reviewed and updated periodically.</li>
                            <li>**Residual Risk Assessment:** *After* defining the response plan, meticulously reassess the Probability and Impact *assuming the plan is successfully implemented*. Document the **Residual Risk Level** and the rationale in Jira/Confluence. If residual risk is still unacceptably high (e.g., High/Critical), **mandate escalation** to PM/Steering Committee and development of alternative/additional responses.</li>

         <div class="section-description">
            <p>These formal Change and Risk Management processes are designed to overlay, not replace, the Agile framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Change vs. Backlog:** The CCB handles changes *to the baseline*. The Product Owner manages priority and refinement *within* the baseline via the backlog. Small adjustments or clarifications identified during grooming are typically *not* formal CRs. Significant deviations emerging from grooming *should* trigger a CR.</li>
                <li>**Risk Actions in Sprints:** Mitigation or contingency actions identified in the Risk Plan become concrete tasks or User Stories in the Product Backlog, prioritized by the PO alongside features. The work gets done within sprints.</li>
                <li>**Transparency:** Jira/ADO serves as the central hub. CRs and Risks are issue types alongside User Stories and Bugs, providing integrated visibility on project boards and dashboards.</li>
                <li>**Cadence Alignment:** CCB meetings and Risk reviews are scheduled to align with sprint cadences and MBR reporting cycles, ensuring timely information flow.</li>
                <li>**Focus:** Agile focuses on *delivering value iteratively within defined boundaries*. Formal PM focuses on *managing changes to those boundaries* and *proactively addressing threats* to achieving the overall objectives.</li>
