    <h1>NYCPS Transportation Management System: Prescriptive SDLC & Setup</h1>

    <!-- Introduction & Methodology -->
    <section id="introduction-methodology">
        <h2>Introduction & Methodology</h2>
        <div class="phase-description">
            <p>This document establishes the definitive Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to be rigorously followed for the NYCPS Transportation Management System project (RFP R1804). Recognizing the project's criticality, scale, security sensitivities, AWS GovCloud deployment context, and demanding 12-month delivery timeframe, this SDLC mandates an <strong>Agile (Scrum-based) methodology deeply integrated with DevSecOps principles.</strong></p>
            <p>Adherence to this SDLC is mandatory. Its core tenets are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Iterative & Incremental Delivery:</strong> We will deliver functional, tested software increments in defined Sprints (typically 2 weeks), aligned with the major project phases. Each Sprint delivers a potentially shippable product increment.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Collaboration:</strong> Continuous, structured engagement with NYCPS (OPT, DIIT, Security, Schools, etc.) is embedded in the process through defined meetings and review cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Pervasive Automation:</strong> We will automate testing (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security), infrastructure provisioning (IaC), builds, deployments, and monitoring to the maximum extent feasible.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated Security ("Shift Left"):</strong> Security is not an afterthought. Security requirements, threat modeling, secure coding practices, code analysis (SAST), vulnerability scanning (SCA, DAST), and security reviews are integral to every phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency & Adaptability:</strong> Project progress, risks, and decisions will be transparent via dashboards and regular reporting. The Agile framework allows for controlled adaptation based on feedback and evolving understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Built-in Quality:</strong> Quality assurance is embedded through TDD/BDD, stringent code reviews, comprehensive automated testing, clear Definitions of Ready (DoR) and Done (DoD), and dedicated QA resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance & Compliance:</strong> Formal governance checkpoints and stakeholder sign-offs ensure alignment and compliance throughout the lifecycle.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

        <div class="setup-description">
            <p>Implementing the SDLC described above requires careful configuration of tools, establishment of process discipline, and fostering a collaborative culture. Below are detailed steps to set up the core components.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Establish Foundational AWS GovCloud Environment:</strong>

                        <li>Configure AWS Organizations for centralized governance and billing across accounts. Apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce security guardrails (e.g., restricting regions, preventing disabling of security services).</li>
                        <li>Set up AWS Budgets and Cost Anomaly Detection for cost control.</li>
                        <li>Implement foundational IAM:

                        <li>Create CloudWatch Log Groups with appropriate retention policies (e.g., shorter retention for debug logs, longer for audit logs).</li>
                        <li>Set up CloudWatch Metric Filters to extract key metrics from logs (e.g., error counts, specific event occurrences).</li>
                        <li>Create CloudWatch Alarms based on key metrics (CPU, memory, disk, latency, error rates, queue depth, custom application metrics) with defined thresholds and actions (e.g., trigger auto-scaling, send SNS notification).</li>

                        <li>Deploy initial versions of core services (e.g., databases, basic APIs) via the CI/CD pipeline to DEV/TEST.</li>
                        <li>Develop and run scripts to populate TEST environment databases with anonymized or synthetic seed data necessary for initial development and testing.</li>
