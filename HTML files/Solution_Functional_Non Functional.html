    <h1>NYCPS Transportation Management System - Solution Design (RFP R1804)</h1>
    <section id="preamble-intro" style="background-color: #f0f4f8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1em 0 2.5em 0; border: 1px solid #d6e0eb;">
        <h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #d6e0eb; color: #004080; font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 0;">Preamble: Functional & Non-Functional Requirements Alignment</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">This Solution Design document, while primarily focused on <strong>functional requirements</strong> (defining <em>what</em> the system does for each component like GPS tracking, routing logic, ridership recording, user modules, reporting), intrinsically lays the necessary groundwork for and implicitly addresses the critical <strong>non-functional requirements (NFRs)</strong> mandated by RFP R1804.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">The subsequent Architecture document will detail the specific technical implementation ('how'), but the functional capabilities defined herein necessitate that the architecture meets these NFRs:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 40px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Security & Compliance:</strong> The functional need to handle PII/Confidential Information, manage user access (RBAC), integrate securely with ticketing/NYCPS systems, and enable device management mandates an architecture incorporating robust encryption, strict access controls, secure APIs, MDM capabilities, and adherence to policies (FERPA, NY Ed Law 2-d, NYCPS/NYC3/OTI).</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Observability (Logging/Monitoring/Alerting):</strong> Functional requirements for audit trails (OPT Admin, Routing), system alerts (Notifications, Routing Conflicts), KPI displays (Admin Modules), and ticketing integration necessitate underlying architectural support for comprehensive logging, metrics collection, and alerting systems.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Scalability:</strong> The functional scope covering ~10k buses and ~500k+ users inherently demands a highly scalable architecture, which the modular design facilitates.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Performance:</strong> Functional requirements for "near real-time" GPS updates, ETAs, notifications, and responsive user interfaces mandate a performant architecture optimized for low latency.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Reliability/Availability:</strong> The critical nature of student transportation and high SLA targets (e.g., 99.999999% for GPS) functionally require a highly available and resilient architecture (Multi-AZ, DR) capable of meeting defined RPO/RTO targets.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The functional requirement for user-facing modules necessitates adherence to WCAG 2.0 AA standards in the architecture and frontend implementation.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Maintainability/Adaptability:</strong> The modular functional design promotes a corresponding modular architecture, enhancing maintainability and the ability to adapt to evolving NYCPS system integrations and future requirements.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Data Management (Integrity, Retention):</strong> Functional responsibilities for data validation, synchronization, 7-year archival, and ensuring data ownership are built into component descriptions and demand corresponding architectural support for data pipelines, storage tiers, and governance controls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 1.5em;">In essence, this Solution Design defines the necessary capabilities, which inherently set the NFR benchmarks that the subsequent AWS GovCloud Architecture must achieve through specific service choices and design patterns.</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>This document outlines the functional design for the NYCPS Office of Pupil Transportation (OPT) Transportation Management System. The system aims to provide a single, integrated platform for near real-time bus location tracking, student ridership recording, dynamic route optimization, and seamless communication among all stakeholders (OPT staff, school administrators, bus vendors (SBCs), drivers, parents/caregivers, and students). The solution will replace legacy systems and serve as the new system of record for GPS, routing, and ridership data.</p>
