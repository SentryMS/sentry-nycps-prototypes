    <h1>NYCPS TMS: Prescriptive User Onboarding, Adoption, Migration & Delight Strategy</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>I. Introduction: Vision, Principles & Scope</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>This document mandates the comprehensive, state-of-the-art strategy for managing the entire user journey for the NYCPS Transportation Management System (TMS) â€“ from initial awareness and onboarding, through process migration, to sustained adoption, active usage, and ultimate user delight. Our vision extends beyond mere system deployment; we aim to transform the daily transportation experience for hundreds of thousands of students, parents, guardians, school staff, OPT personnel, and bus operator teams, making it safer, more predictable, more efficient, and significantly less stressful.</p>
            <p>Given the scale (~500k+ end-users initially), diversity of user personas (varying technical proficiency, languages, needs, roles), reliance on external parties (SBCs), and the critical nature of the service, this strategy emphasizes a **human-centric, proactive, data-driven, multi-channel, and iterative approach.** Success is defined not just by system go-live, but by measurable user adoption, satisfaction, and the achievement of positive behavioral changes enabled by the TMS.</p>
            <div class="principle-box">
                 <h4>Core User Journey Principles (Mandatory Adherence):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User-Centricity Above All:</strong> Every decision regarding onboarding, communication, training, support, and feature design *must* prioritize the needs, context, and experience of the specific user persona being addressed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplicity & Clarity:** Onboarding processes, user interfaces, training materials, and communications *must* be exceptionally clear, concise, intuitive, and easy to understand, minimizing cognitive load and friction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proactive & Personalized Communication:** Engage users early and often through targeted, relevant communications via preferred channels, anticipating needs and providing timely updates.</li>
                    <li>**Multi-Channel Support & Enablement:** Offer diverse support options (self-service KB, video, chat, phone, potentially in-person) and training formats (online, VILT, job aids) catering to different learning styles and technical abilities.</li>
                    <li>**Data-Driven Iteration:** Continuously measure user adoption, engagement, satisfaction, and friction points. Use this data to rapidly iterate and improve onboarding flows, training content, support processes, and the application itself.</li>
                    <li>**Building Trust & Confidence:** Emphasize system reliability, data security/privacy, and responsiveness to feedback to build user trust from day one.</li>
                    <li>**Positive Reinforcement & Delight (Where Appropriate):** Go beyond basic functionality to create moments of positive reinforcement and ease-of-use that encourage adoption and positive sentiment (includes potential for ethical gamification).</li>
                    <li>**Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Ensure all user-facing components, communications, and training materials meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards and are available in mandated NYCPS languages.</li>
                </ul>

    <!-- User Account Migration & Onboarding -->
    <section id="account-migration-onboarding">
        <h2>IV. User Account Migration & Onboarding Process (RFP Sec 3.28.6 Focus)</h2>
        <div class="section-description">
            <p>This section details the prescriptive technical and procedural steps for securely and efficiently getting ~500k+ users into the new TMS system, leveraging existing identity sources where possible.</p>

            <h3>A. Guiding Principles for Onboarding</h3>
             <div class="subsection">
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seamless Experience:** Aim for minimal friction, especially for Parents/Students already using systems like NYCSA.</li>
                    <li>**Security First:** Employ robust identity verification and secure authentication (SSO/MFA) methods. Comply strictly with data privacy regulations during data linking.</li>
                    <li>**Clarity & Guidance:** Provide simple, step-by-step instructions within the app/portal and supporting materials.</li>
                    <li>**Scalability:** Design processes and technical integrations capable of handling high volumes during peak onboarding periods.</li>
                    <li>**Data Accuracy:** Ensure accurate mapping and linking of user identities between TMS and source systems (NYCSA, DOE Directory, SBC Rosters).</li>
                 </ul>
             </div>

            <h3>B. Technical Strategy: Identity Federation & Provisioning</h3>
             <div class="implementation-detail">
                 <h6>Implementation How-To:</h6>
                 <ol>
                    <li><strong>Parent/Student Onboarding (Primary Path - NYCSA Integration):**
                        <ul>
                            <li>**Federation Setup:** Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC) between TMS (acting as Service Provider - SP) and the NYCPS NYCSA Identity Provider (IdP). Requires close collaboration with DIIT team managing NYCSA IdP. Configure trust, attribute mapping (securely passing verified parent/guardian ID and linked student IDs), and secure key exchange within AWS Cognito (or equivalent IAM Identity Provider configuration).</li>
                            <li>**Onboarding Flow:**
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>User downloads TMS Parent App/visits web portal.</li>

                                    <li>User is redirected securely to NYCSA login page.</li>
                                    <li>User authenticates with NYCSA credentials (MFA if applicable).</li>
                                    <li>Upon successful NYCSA authentication, user is redirected back to TMS with a secure assertion (SAML response or OIDC token) containing verified identity attributes.</li>
                                    <li>TMS backend validates the assertion, extracts necessary identifiers (Parent ID, linked Student IDs).</li>
                                    <li>TMS automatically provisions the parent account and links associated student profiles based on the verified identifiers received from NYCSA.</li>
                                    <li>User is logged into the TMS app/portal. Minimal/no additional data entry required.</li>

                            <li>**Requirement:** For users without NYCSA or needing to link later. Requires careful identity verification.</li>
                            <li>**Registration Flow:**
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>User selects "Register New Account" in app/portal.</li>

                                    <li>**Identity Verification:** Implement a robust process to link the account to specific student(s). Options (requires NYCPS policy decision & technical implementation):
                                        <ul><li>A: Use unique, secure invitation code sent separately via mail/email based on existing DOE records.</li><li>B: Require user to input verifiable student information (e.g., Student ID + DOB + School - *requires careful security/privacy review*).</li><li>C: Route registration request to designated School Administrators for manual verification/approval via their TMS console.</li></ul></li>
                                    <li>Upon successful verification, link student(s) to the parent account in TMS backend.</li>

Map directory attributes to assign appropriate TMS roles (School Admin, OPT Router, etc.) based on group membership or employee attributes.</li>
                            <li>**Secondary Path (Invitation):** If SSO not feasible for all staff, use a secure invitation system (e.g., Cognito User Pools invite flow) sent to official DOE email addresses. Initial role assignment potentially based on invitation context or requires admin approval post-registration. MFA mandatory.</li>

                                    <li>OPT provides validated lists of authorized personnel (linked to PETS clearance status) per SBC to the TMS system regularly.</li>
                                    <li>**Option A (SBC Admin Managed):** Provide SBC Admin console functionality for designated SBC managers to invite their staff (drivers, attendants, dispatchers) using official email/phone. TMS validates invitee against the authorized OPT list before sending secure registration link. SBC Admin assigns initial role.</li>
                                    <li>**Option B (Direct Invite):** TMS system sends direct invitations (via email/SMS) to authorized personnel from OPT lists with secure registration links. Requires reliable contact info from OPT.</li>
                                    <li>Registration involves secure password creation + MFA setup (e.g., SMS or authenticator app via Cognito).</li>

                        <ul>
                           <li>**Geography:** By Borough, then by District within Borough.</li>
                           <li>**School Bus Contractor (SBC):** By groups of willing/capable pilot SBCs, then expanding.</li>
                           <li>**User Type:** Internal OPT users first, then School Admins/SBC Dispatchers, then Drivers, then Parents/Students.</li>
                           <li>**Route Type:** Special Education routes first (potentially higher need for tracking), then General Education.</li>
                           <li>**Combination:** A hybrid approach (e.g., Pilot 1-2 Districts covering all route types/users within those districts, then expand district-by-district). **(Recommended Approach)**</li>

                            <li>Select a small (~2-5% of total volume), representative pilot group (e.g., 1-2 Community School Districts with a mix of school types, SE/GE routes, and participating SBCs).</li>
                            <li>Define clear entry/exit criteria and success metrics for the pilot phase (e.g., >90% device uptime, >85% successful ridership scan rate, core workflows functional, support volume manageable, positive initial user feedback).</li>
                            <li>Duration: Typically 4-8 weeks of operational use after technical deployment.</li>
                            <li>Intensive monitoring, feedback collection (surveys, focus groups), and support during this phase.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>**Formal Go/No-Go Decisions:** Implement formal Go/No-Go checkpoints before starting the pilot and before initiating each subsequent rollout wave, based on technical readiness, operational preparedness, training completion, and pilot/previous wave success metrics. Requires sign-off from Project Leadership/Steering Committee.</li>
                     <li>**Technical Enablement:** Ensure CI/CD pipelines and feature flagging mechanisms (if used) support phased rollout (e.g., deploying features only to users/devices associated with the current wave's districts/SBCs).</li>
